This is my solution for the [CodeBasics](https://codebasics.io/) challenge #6!

### Description
**Objective**
Develop a powerful dashboard for CodeX's marketing team to gain a deeper understanding of the Indian market and drive data-driven decision-making for impactful results.

CodeX is a German Beverage Company aiming to make its mark in the Indian market. A few months ago, they launched their energy drink in Tier1 and Tier2 cities of India, and recently a survey was conducted in all those cities. My task was to analyze the survey results and provide meaningful insights to CodeX to improve its hold on the market share.

**Tools Used**
